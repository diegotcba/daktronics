==========

A python-based serial data analyzer for the Daktronics omnisport timing console. Tested with the Omnisport 2000 with a RS232 to USB cable. 

The console has an RTD port used normally for Venus scoreboards. It is just a simple 19200 baud 8N1 serial signal, and carries the running time, splits, and swimmer names.
