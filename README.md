==========

A python-based serial data analyzer for the Daktronics omnisport timing console. Tested with the Omnisport 2000 console with a RS232 to USB cable. 
The Omnisport 2000 has an RTD port normally used for Venus scoreboards, but it is a simple 19200 baud 8N1 serial signal that carries the running time, splits, and swimmer names.
